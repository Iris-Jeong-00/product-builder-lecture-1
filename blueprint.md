# Project Blueprint

## Overview

A simple web application for a random English word test.

## Features

*   Displays a random English word.
*   Allows users to input the meaning of the word.
*   Checks if the user's answer is correct.
*   Displays the correct answer if the user is wrong.
*   Provides a button to load the next word.

## Implemented Features

### V1 - Initial Setup

*   **HTML Structure:** Basic `index.html` with necessary elements.
*   **JavaScript Logic:** `main.js` with a small dictionary and core test functionality.
*   **CSS Styling:** Basic `style.css` for layout.

## Current Plan: V2 - Enhanced Experience

I will now enhance the application with the following improvements:

1.  **Expanded Dictionary:** Add a much larger set of words and meanings to `main.js` to make the test more challenging and useful.
2.  **Polished Visual Design:** Overhaul `style.css` to create a modern and visually appealing interface. This will include:
    *   **Typography:** Using a custom font from Google Fonts for better readability and style.
    *   **Color Palette:** A more refined color scheme.
    *   **Layout & Spacing:** Improved layout for better visual hierarchy.
    *   **Effects:** Adding subtle shadows and hover effects for a more interactive feel.
3.  **HTML Update:** Add the new font link to `index.html`.
